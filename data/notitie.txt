\Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::listen(function ($query){
            logger($query->sql);
        });


In a Laravel project, the code \Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::listen(function ($query){ logger($query->sql); }); sets up a listener for all database queries executed using the DB facade.

The listen() method allows you to register a listener that will be called each time a database query is executed. In this case, the listener is a closure that takes a single parameter $query representing the query that was executed.

Inside the closure, the logger() function is called to log the SQL statement of the query. The logger() function is a helper function provided by Laravel that logs a message to the application's log files.

By using this code, you can monitor and log all the SQL queries that are executed by your Laravel application, which can be useful for debugging and performance optimization.
